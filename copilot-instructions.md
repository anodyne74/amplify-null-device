# Copilot Instructions for nd-assets (React + AWS Cognito)

## Project Overview
This project is a React app (created with Vite) that uses AWS Cognito for secure login and admin access. It also embeds a Google Map. Only authenticated users can access the admin area.

## How to Use GitHub Copilot
- Use Copilot to generate code snippets, automate repetitive tasks, and get suggestions for React, AWS Amplify, and Cognito integration.
- You can ask Copilot to:
  - Add new features (e.g., admin tools, custom styles)
  - Help with Cognito or Amplify configuration
  - Troubleshoot authentication or deployment issues

## AWS Cognito Integration
- Update `Amplify.configure` in `src/App.jsx` with your Cognito region, user pool ID, and app client ID.
- Use the Authenticator component for login/logout and user session management.
- Place admin features inside the authenticated section of the app.

## Deployment
- Deploy as a static site to AWS S3 or use GitHub Actions for automated deployment.
- For S3, sync the build output (`dist` folder) to your S3 bucket.
- For GitHub Actions, set up secrets for AWS credentials and bucket info.

## Customization
- Edit `src/App.jsx` to change the map, add content, or update styles.
- Ask Copilot for help with React, Amplify, or new features.

## Troubleshooting
- If authentication fails, check Cognito configuration and Amplify setup.
- For deployment issues, verify AWS credentials and bucket permissions.
- Ask Copilot for help debugging issues.
